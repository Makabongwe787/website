                    <h2>Technology Exploration & Innovation</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a Computer Science student, my primary hobby is exploring technology itself. I spend significant time diving into 
                        emerging tools, software platforms, and development frameworks that are shaping the digital landscape. This isn't passive 
                        consumption—it's active engagement with the field I'm studying and planning to enter professionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy experimenting with new programming languages, testing development environments, and understanding how different 
                        technologies solve similar problems in unique ways. Whether it's exploring a new database system, trying a web development 
                        framework, or learning about cloud infrastructure, I approach each exploration with curiosity and a desire to understand 
                        the underlying principles that make these tools powerful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This hands-on experimentation goes beyond classroom requirements. It's driven by genuine curiosity about innovation and a 
                        desire to stay current in a field that evolves rapidly. By actively exploring technology, I'm building a foundation of 
                        knowledge that will serve me well as I progress in my career and encounter new tools and challenges.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Web Development & System Design -->
                <div class="hobby-section">
                    <h2>Web Development & System Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm particularly passionate about web development and system design. There's something deeply satisfying about taking a 
                        concept and building it into a functioning web application. From designing the user interface to architecting the backend 
                        infrastructure, web development allows me to combine both creative and analytical thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        System design fascinates me because it requires considering multiple components—databases, servers, user interfaces, security, 
                        and performance—and building them into a cohesive whole. I enjoy the challenge of designing scalable, reliable systems that 
                        can handle real-world demands. This interest extends beyond web development into broader system architecture and infrastructure design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working on web-based projects and system design helps me visualize how technology comes together to create meaningful solutions. 
                        It reinforces my understanding that good design isn't just about aesthetics; it's about creating systems that are intuitive, 
                        efficient, and reliable—systems that people can trust and depend on.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Problem-Solving Challenges -->
                <div class="hobby-section">
                    <h2>Problem-Solving & Logical Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        I genuinely enjoy solving problems—whether they're algorithmic challenges, logical puzzles, or real-world scenarios that require 
                        creative thinking. There's a particular satisfaction in breaking down a complex problem, identifying patterns, and finding elegant 
                        solutions that are both efficient and understandable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I participate in problem-solving activities both independently and collaboratively. These challenges push my critical thinking, 
                        encourage me to explore different approaches, and reinforce fundamental Computer Science concepts. More importantly, they train 
                        my mind to think algorithmically—to decompose problems into manageable parts and build comprehensive solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This hobby isn't just about solving puzzles; it's about developing the mindset of a computer scientist. It's about learning to 
                        approach challenges systematically, remain calm under pressure, and persist in finding solutions—skills that are invaluable both 
                        in academics and in professional development work.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Continuous Learning -->
                <div class="hobby-section">
                    <h2>Continuous Learning & Self-Improvement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps my most significant hobby is continuous self-learning. I recognize that formal education, while foundational, is just 
                        the beginning. The field of technology evolves so rapidly that staying relevant requires constant learning and adaptation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spend time reading technical documentation, following industry blogs, watching educational content, and experimenting with 
                        new concepts. Whether it's learning about advanced database optimization techniques, exploring artificial intelligence concepts, 
                        or understanding cloud computing architectures, I'm committed to expanding my knowledge continuously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This commitment to self-learning goes beyond technical skills. I'm also interested in understanding the business side of 
                        technology, ethics in computing, the impact of technology on society, and how to build solutions that are not just technically 
                        sound but also responsible and beneficial to users and communities.

                        <p>
                            I value quiet moments of deep focus—time spent thinking, analyzing, and building. When working on complex problems or 
                            building systems, I need uninterrupted time to think deeply, design thoroughly, and implement carefully. These focused 
                            sessions are when I do my best work and feel most engaged.

                            While I appreciate deep focus time, I equally value collaboration and idea-sharing. I thrive in environments where knowledge 
                            is exchanged freely, where diverse perspectives are welcome, and where creativity is encouraged. Bouncing ideas off others, 
                            learning from different approaches, and collectively solving problems brings out my best thinking.
