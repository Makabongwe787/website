                            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                            <p>
                                I'm Makabongwe Simelane, a dedicated Computer Science student in Year 2 of my Diploma 
                                at Eswatini College of Technology. I'm genuinely curious about how systems work—from the 
                                logic behind a simple program to the architecture of complex digital platforms. My interest 
                                in technology goes beyond theory; I'm motivated by the practical side: how software, networks, 
                                and databases come together to solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Academic Focus -->
                        <div class="about-section">
                            <h2>My Academic Foundation</h2>
                            <p>
                                Throughout my studies, I've developed a strong foundation in web development, database design 
                                using SQL, system analysis, and networking fundamentals. Through coursework and hands-on projects, 
                                I've learned to think logically, break down complex problems, and design structured solutions. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I particularly enjoy the challenge of debugging, optimizing systems, and improving functionality, 
                                because each challenge pushes me to think deeper and learn more. To me, technology is not just about 
                                writing code—it's about building reliable systems that people can actually use and trust. This philosophy 
                                guides everything I create.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Problem Solver & Logical Thinker</h2>
                            <p>
                                As a Computer Science student, I've developed a mindset centered on problem-solving and logical thinking. 
                                I approach challenges by analyzing requirements, breaking them into manageable components, and building 
                                comprehensive solutions. Whether it's designing a database schema, architecting a web-based system, or 
                                optimizing code, I take pride in understanding the "why" behind each decision.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I find satisfaction in seeing an idea transform from concept to working solution. Each project I work on 
                                strengthens my confidence and reinforces my belief that technology can be a powerful tool for creating 
                                meaningful, positive change in the world.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Continuous Learning & Growth</h2>
                            <p>
                                Being a Computer Science student means constantly learning, adapting, and evolving. Technology changes rapidly, 
                                and I embrace that reality. I actively research new tools, understand emerging trends, and sharpen my skills 
                                beyond the classroom—whether diving into database optimization, network communication, or user experience design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I believe that mastery isn't achieved overnight; it's built through consistency, failure, practice, and persistence. 
                                This commitment to continuous improvement drives me to stay curious, explore new technologies, and push my own boundaries 
                                as I grow into a future technology professional.
