                    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Eswatini, a beautiful country in Southern Africa with a rich cultural heritage. 
                        My father's home is in Nhlangano, a meaningful place that connects me to my family's roots and cultural identity. 
                        Growing up in Eswatini shaped my worldview, taught me to appreciate my heritage, and instilled in me a sense 
                        of belonging to a community with shared values and traditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eswatini is a country where community, respect, and cooperation are fundamental to society. These values, deeply 
                        woven into the fabric of my upbringing, continue to influence how I approach relationships, work, and my responsibilities 
                        as a student and future professional. My connection to Nhlangano and to Eswatini as a whole is an integral part of who I am.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Extended Family -->
                <div class="background-section">
                    <h2>Growing Up in an Extended Family</h2>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in an extended family environment, surrounded by many relatives—grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles. 
                        This wasn't a limitation but a blessing. Living in a household with multiple generations and perspectives taught me 
                        invaluable life lessons that shaped my character from an early age. In an extended family, you learn that life is about 
                        relationships, cooperation, and shared responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up this way taught me the importance of respect—not just for elders, but for every person's contribution and perspective. 
                        I learned cooperation when sharing resources and responsibilities was necessary. I developed patience through navigating the 
                        dynamics of living with diverse personalities and preferences. Most importantly, I learned adaptability—the ability to adjust 
                        to different situations, understand various viewpoints, and find common ground with people from different backgrounds and ages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These lessons transcend the domestic sphere. They directly inform how I approach teamwork in academic projects, collaborate with 
                        classmates, and envision working in professional environments. I understand that success is not individual—it is shared. This 
                        mindset has influenced how I view leadership, collaboration, and my role within communities.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Siblings and Family Structure -->
                <div class="background-section">
                    <h2>My Siblings and Family Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        I come from a family of five children: I am one of four siblings. Being part of a larger household with siblings taught me 
                        lessons that continue to shape my discipline, work ethic, and interpersonal skills. Growing up with siblings means learning 
                        early how to negotiate, share, and advocate for your needs while respecting the needs of others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My siblings and I learned negotiation in its rawest form—managing shared spaces, dividing chores, and balancing individual 
                        desires with family needs. We learned to support each other through challenges and celebrate each other's victories. These 
                        experiences taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of standing my ground while also being willing to compromise 
                        for the greater good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surprisingly, these sibling dynamics translate remarkably well into group projects, problem-solving sessions, and real-world 
                        work environments. The same skills that helped me navigate family life—communication, empathy, problem-solving, and mutual 
                        support—are essential in professional collaborations. My siblings are my first teachers in teamwork, and that foundation 
                        has served me well as a student and will continue to be invaluable in my career.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Family Values -->
                <div class="background-section">
                    <h2>Values Shaped by My Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        My upbringing in Eswatini, within an extended family, has given me a strong foundation of values that continue to guide me. 
                        These aren't abstract principles—they're lived experiences embedded in everything I do.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Respect -->
                    <div class="value-subsection">
                        <h3>Respect</h3>
                        <p>
                            Growing up in a culture that deeply values respect for elders, family, and community, I learned that respect is the foundation 
                            of all meaningful relationships. This extends to respecting diverse perspectives, acknowledging different strengths, and 
                            valuing the contributions of every team member.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Cooperation</h3>
                        <p>
                            In an extended family, cooperation is necessary and natural. I learned that working together toward common goals is more 
                            powerful than individual effort. This value shapes how I approach collaborative projects and how I contribute to team 
                            environments—always seeking ways to work synergistically with others.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Responsibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being part of a large family meant having responsibilities that extended beyond myself. I understood early that my actions 
                            affect others and that taking ownership of my commitments is essential. This sense of responsibility extends to my academic 
                            work, my relationship with technology, and my vision for creating solutions that positively impact communities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Living with multiple generations and diverse personalities required flexibility and the ability to adjust to different 
                            situations. As a Computer Science student, adaptability is critical—technology evolves constantly, and the ability to 
                            learn, adjust, and apply new knowledge is essential to success and growth.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        My background—both geographic and familial—is not something I've moved past; it's something I carry forward. The values I 
                        learned, the perspectives I gained, and the resilience I developed are the foundation of who I am today and who I aspire to become.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These early life experiences continue to shape my discipline, work ethic, and interpersonal skills. They inform how I approach 
                        challenges, collaborate with peers, and envision contributing to organizations and communities in the future. I am proud of my 
                        roots, grateful for the lessons my family taught me, and committed to carrying those values forward as I grow as a technology 
                        professional and as a person.
